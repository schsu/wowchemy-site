ASAML is a group funded by an NSF HDR focused on applying accelerated machine learning to two big data science experiements: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory . The goal for this work is to both apply machine learning and hardware based machine learning acceleration to enhance the speed and quality of detector reconstruction. This work is affiliated with the large Fast Machine Learning lab and the NSF CSSI.
