Fast ML Lab is a research collective of physicists, engineers, and computer scientists interested in deploying machine learning algorithms for unique and challenging scientific applications. Our projects range from real-time, on-detector and low latency machine learning applications to high-throughput heterogeneous computing big data challenges. We are interested in deploying sophisticated machine learning algorithms to advance the exploration of fundamental physics from the world's biggest colliders to the most intense particle beams to the cosmos.
